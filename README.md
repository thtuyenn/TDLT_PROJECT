### Description:
This project is a **Simple Math Calculator** application with a basic graphical user interface (GUI).  

**Core Functionality:** It performs standard arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division) between two numbers.  

**User Input:** The interface features two input fields labelled "A coeff:" and "B coeff:" for the user to enter the two operands.  

**Controls:** Four distinct buttons (+, -, x, :) allow the user to select the desired mathematical operation.  

**Output:** A designated field labeled "Result :" displays the outcome of the calculation after a button is pressed.
